# Upgrading Karpenter

Keeping Karpenter up to date is pretty helpful since a whole bunch of new features gets added in with every major release. Additionally, Karpenter is the tool used to decide which machines your applications would run on, so any cost-efficiency improvements that get added in with every release would help reduce infrastructure expenses. Finally, if you are on a managed Kubernetes service such as AWS EKS, you are required to update the version of EKS to the latest supported version once every 3 months. Older versions of Karpenter can end up getting unsupported during such an upgrade, so it's best to keep the two in sync.

So to start, the first thing you should do is look at the [compatibilty matrix](https://karpenter.sh/v1.0/upgrading/compatibility/). Once you have confirmed that your cluster version and the new version of Karpenter are compatible, let's look at upgrading.

The Karpenter docs already provide detailed instructions on upgrading, including a full [upgrade guide](https://karpenter.sh/docs/upgrading/upgrade-guide/) for every version. Since the switch to version 1.0 has major breaking changes, there is an [additional guide](https://karpenter.sh/v1.0/upgrading/v1-migration/) for that. However, all these guides assume you have installed Karpenter and its CRDs with Helm. This might not be the case if instead of directly installing Karpenter, you first ran cluster autoscaler and then decided to follow the migration guide to switch to Karpenter.

We will be focusing on this scenario. In this case, let's say you had an old 0.3x version of Karpenter installed with Helm. This guide will cover the process of upgrading to the latest version (v1.3.3 at the time of writing) without getting any downtime. The process will be as follows:

- Remove the current Karpenter version not installed by Helm
- Install the same Karpenter version but with Helm this time
- Upgrade to the latest minor version with Helm
- Upgrade to v1.0
- Switch resources to be compatible with the latest supported Karpenter version
- Upgrade to v1.3

For starters, you need to define the correct variables:

```bash
export KARPENTER_NAMESPACE=kube-system
export KARPENTER_VERSION=0.37.0
export K8S_VERSION=1.30

export AWS_PARTITION="aws" # if you are not using standard partitions, you may need to configure to aws-cn / aws-us-gov
export CLUSTER_NAME=<cluster-name>
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID="$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)"
export TEMPOUT=$(mktemp)
export ARM_AMI_ID="$(aws ssm get-parameter --name /aws/service/eks/optimized-ami/${K8S_VERSION}/amazon-linux-2-arm64/recommended/image_id --region us-east-1 --query Parameter.Value --output text)"
export AMD_AMI_ID="$(aws ssm get-parameter --name /aws/service/eks/optimized-ami/${K8S_VERSION}/amazon-linux-2/recommended/image_id --region us-east-1 --query Parameter.Value --output text)"
export GPU_AMI_ID="$(aws ssm get-parameter --name /aws/service/eks/optimized-ami/${K8S_VERSION}/amazon-linux-2-gpu/recommended/image_id --region us-east-1 --query Parameter.Value --output text)"

export CLUSTER_ENDPOINT="$(aws eks describe-cluster --name ${CLUSTER_NAME} --region us-east-1 --query "cluster.endpoint" --output text)"
export KARPENTER_IAM_ROLE_ARN="arn:${AWS_PARTITION}:iam::${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}:role/KarpenterControllerRole-${CLUSTER_NAME}"
```

For the Karpenter version, get your current version with:

```bash
kubectl get deployment -A -l app.kubernetes.io/name=karpenter -ojsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.labels['app\.kubernetes\.io/version']}{'\n'}"
```

Then set that exact version. Also make sure to set the cluster name, region, and k8s version. Now that the variables are set, let's delete the old Karpenter before installing the new one. Since the only other way to install Karpenter is by generating the `Karpenter.yaml`, you need to simply run the delete command:

```bash
kubectl delete -f karpenter.yaml
```

This will delete most resources related to Karpenter, but won't result in your running node pools and node classes being deleted. This is because the CRDs used for these custom resources are installed separately, and not as part of the `karpenter.yaml`. These CRDs should **never be deleted** and only updated, since their removal also means the removal of your nodes and thereby downtime. However, it is fine (and required) to update them.

Since Karpenter is gone, the first step is done and we need to quickly re-install it since node scaling won't be happening during this period. As the variables are already defined:

```bash
# Logout of helm registry to perform an unauthenticated pull against the public ECR
helm registry logout public.ecr.aws

helm upgrade --install karpenter oci://public.ecr.aws/karpenter/karpenter --version "${KARPENTER_VERSION}" --namespace "${KARPENTER_NAMESPACE}" --create-namespace \
  --set "serviceAccount.annotations.eks\.amazonaws\.com/role-arn=${KARPENTER_IAM_ROLE_ARN}" \
  --set "settings.clusterName=${CLUSTER_NAME}" \
  --set controller.resources.requests.cpu=1 \
  --set controller.resources.requests.memory=1Gi \
  --set controller.resources.limits.cpu=1 \
  --set controller.resources.limits.memory=1Gi \
  --set webhook.enabled=true \
  --set webhook.port=8443 \
  --wait
```

Re-check the Karpenter version now:

```bash
kubectl get deployment -A -l app.kubernetes.io/name=karpenter -ojsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.labels['app\.kubernetes\.io/version']}{'\n'}"
```

Also, check the Karpenter pods and ensure that they are working as expected. If you are on a production cluster, you can run a test app on a separate node pool to double-verify that node scaling is active.

Now that we've switched to Helm, we can move on to the next steps. We start by moving to the latest minor version of the current Karpenter version. If you are using 0.37.0, the latest minor version would be 0.37.7:

```bash
export KARPENTER_VERSION="0.37.7" # Replace with your minor version

# Service account annotation can be dropped when using pod identity
helm upgrade --install karpenter oci://public.ecr.aws/karpenter/karpenter --version ${KARPENTER_VERSION} --namespace "${KARPENTER_NAMESPACE}" --create-namespace \
  --set serviceAccount.annotations."eks\.amazonaws\.com/role-arn"=${KARPENTER_IAM_ROLE_ARN} \
  --set settings.clusterName=${CLUSTER_NAME} \
  --set controller.resources.requests.cpu=1 \
  --set controller.resources.requests.memory=1Gi \
  --set controller.resources.limits.cpu=1 \
  --set controller.resources.limits.memory=1Gi \
  --set webhook.enabled=true \
  --set webhook.port=8443 \
  --wait
  ```

If you look at the official doc, you would see that you need to also update the CRDs with Helm. If you had installed Karpenter with Helm in the first place this would be correct, but since you didn't, you can't use Helm. One option would be to delete the resources and re-create them but that would result in downtime. So instead, simply update them with `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f \
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/karpenter-provider-aws/v${KARPENTER_VERSION}/pkg/apis/crds/karpenter.sh_nodepools.yaml"
kubectl apply -f \
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/karpenter-provider-aws/v${KARPENTER_VERSION}/pkg/apis/crds/karpenter.k8s.aws_ec2nodeclasses.yaml"
kubectl apply -f \
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/karpenter-provider-aws/v${KARPENTER_VERSION}/pkg/apis/crds/karpenter.sh_nodeclaims.yaml"
```

Now you are in the latest minor version of the old version. You can proceed to perform any tests again to verify that Karpenter works, and afterwards its time to finally move to v1.0:

```bash

export KARPENTER_VERSION="1.0.9"

# Service account annotion can be dropped when using pod identity
helm upgrade --install karpenter oci://public.ecr.aws/karpenter/karpenter --version ${KARPENTER_VERSION} --namespace "${KARPENTER_NAMESPACE}" --create-namespace \
  --set serviceAccount.annotations."eks\.amazonaws\.com/role-arn"=${KARPENTER_IAM_ROLE_ARN} \
  --set settings.clusterName=${CLUSTER_NAME} \
  --set controller.resources.requests.cpu=1 \
  --set controller.resources.requests.memory=1Gi \
  --set controller.resources.limits.cpu=1 \
  --set controller.resources.limits.memory=1Gi \
  --wait

kubectl apply -f \
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/karpenter-provider-aws/v${KARPENTER_VERSION}/pkg/apis/crds/karpenter.sh_nodepools.yaml"
kubectl apply -f \
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/karpenter-provider-aws/v${KARPENTER_VERSION}/pkg/apis/crds/karpenter.k8s.aws_ec2nodeclasses.yaml"
kubectl apply -f \
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/karpenter-provider-aws/v${KARPENTER_VERSION}/pkg/apis/crds/karpenter.sh_nodeclaims.yaml"
```

You'll notice these were the steps we took for the previous version upgrade. This will in fact be the same steps that you need to take to upgrade to any version going forward. Now that we are on version 1.0, there are a few important steps that we need to complete.

Version 1.0 is the only version that supports both the old and the new specification at the same time. So if you are using 1.0 and still using the old specification, Karpenter will continue to work as intended. However, if you were to switch to any version above 1.0, Karpenter would start failing since versions above 1.0 don't support the old specification. Now, start by opening up your NodeClass files and ensure that the specifications are up to date. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: karpenter.k8s.aws/v1beta1
kind: EC2NodeClass
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  amiFamily: AL2
  role: "KarpenterNodeRole-test"
  subnetSelectorTerms:
    - tags:
        karpenter.sh/discovery: "test"
  securityGroupSelectorTerms:
    - tags:
        karpenter.sh/discovery: "test"
  amiSelectorTerms:
    - id: "ami-03d24239f12d53c4a"
    - id: "ami-09c00c2e93ce7bd23"
```

This would turn to:

```yaml
apiVersion: karpenter.k8s.aws/v1
kind: EC2NodeClass
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  amiFamily: AL2
  role: "KarpenterNodeRole-test"
  subnetSelectorTerms:
    - tags:
        karpenter.sh/discovery: "test"
  securityGroupSelectorTerms:
    - tags:
        karpenter.sh/discovery: "test"
  amiSelectorTerms:
    - id: "ami-03d24239f12d53c4a"
    - id: "ami-09c00c2e93ce7bd23"
```

Note that `karpenter.k8s.aws/v1beta1` becomes `karpenter.k8s.aws/v1` since the `v1beta1` is no longer supported. Apart from this, there are no other changes for this NodeClass. Check the [node class docs](https://karpenter.sh/docs/concepts/nodeclasses/) and go through your nodeclass defintion. Next, let's look at NodePools. There are much more changes in NodePools than node classes. For example, let's take:

```yaml
apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1beta1
kind: NodePool
metadata:
  name: nodepool-test
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      requirements:
        - key: kubernetes.io/arch
          operator: In
          values: ["amd64"]
        - key: kubernetes.io/os
          operator: In
          values: ["linux"]
        - key: karpenter.sh/capacity-type
          operator: In
          values: ["on-demand"]
        - key: karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-category
          operator: In
          values: ["c", "m", "r", "t", "g"]
        - key: karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-generation
          operator: Gt
          values: ["2"]
        - key: karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-memory
          operator: Gt
          values: ["4000"]
      nodeClassRef:
        apiVersion: karpenter.k8s.aws/v1beta1
        kind: EC2NodeClass
        name: nodeclass-test
  disruption:
    consolidationPolicy: WhenUnderutilized
    expireAfter: 720h
```

Now let's look at the Nodepool after the necessary changes are done:

```yaml
apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1
kind: NodePool
metadata:
  name: nodepool-test
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      requirements:
        - key: kubernetes.io/arch
          operator: In
          values: ["amd64"]
        - key: kubernetes.io/os
          operator: In
          values: ["linux"]
        - key: karpenter.sh/capacity-type
          operator: In
          values: ["on-demand"]
        - key: karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-category
          operator: In
          values: ["c", "m", "r", "t"]
        - key: karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-generation
          operator: Gt
          values: ["2"]
        - key: karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-memory
          operator: Gt
          values: ["4000"]
      nodeClassRef:
        group: karpenter.k8s.aws
        kind: EC2NodeClass
        name: nodeclass-test
      expireAfter: 720h # 30 * 24h = 1h
  disruption:
    consolidationPolicy: WhenEmptyOrUnderutilized
    consolidateAfter: 1m
```

As with the NodeClass the `apiVersion` has been switched to `karpenter.sh/v1`. The keys for the requirements such as `karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-category` and `kubernetes.io/os` are primarily untouched so you don't need to look into them too much. The next part has some critical changes. First off, `apiVersion` is no longer around, and `group: karpenter.k8s.aws` is now required. `expireAfter` has been moved out of the `disruption` section up to the `spec` section. `consolidationPolicy: WhenUnderutilized` no longer exists and has been replaced with `WhenEmptyOrUnderutilized` and `consolidateAfter` is also mandatory now. Look at the [official NodePool definition](https://karpenter.sh/v1.3/concepts/nodepools/) for other changed factors not covered above.

Additionally, node disruption budgets have been introduced for the Karpenter node pools which allow you to specify how your node pools behave at different times of the day and week. To learn more about this, look into [fine tuning disruption budgets](./fine-tuning.md#fine-tuning-disruption-budgets).

Once the changes are finished, we are finally ready to take the final step into the latest version of Karpenter. At the time of writing, it is v1.3.3:

```bash
export KARPENTER_VERSION="1.3.3"


export AWS_PARTITION="aws" # if you are not using standard partitions, you may need to configure to aws-cn / aws-us-gov
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-1"
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID="$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)"
export TEMPOUT="$(mktemp)"

# Logout of helm registry to perform an unauthenticated pull against the public ECR
helm registry logout public.ecr.aws

helm upgrade --install karpenter oci://public.ecr.aws/karpenter/karpenter --version "${KARPENTER_VERSION}" --namespace "${KARPENTER_NAMESPACE}" --create-namespace \
  --set serviceAccount.annotations."eks\.amazonaws\.com/role-arn"=${KARPENTER_IAM_ROLE_ARN} \
  --set "settings.clusterName=${CLUSTER_NAME}" \
  --set controller.resources.requests.cpu=1 \
  --set controller.resources.requests.memory=1Gi \
  --set controller.resources.limits.cpu=1 \
  --set controller.resources.limits.memory=1Gi \
  --wait

kubectl apply -f \
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/karpenter-provider-aws/v${KARPENTER_VERSION}/pkg/apis/crds/karpenter.sh_nodepools.yaml"
kubectl apply -f \
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/karpenter-provider-aws/v${KARPENTER_VERSION}/pkg/apis/crds/karpenter.k8s.aws_ec2nodeclasses.yaml"
kubectl apply -f \
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/karpenter-provider-aws/v${KARPENTER_VERSION}/pkg/apis/crds/karpenter.sh_nodeclaims.yaml"
```

As with before, you follow the same steps. Set the version to the correct one, then run `helm upgrade`. Once the Kubernetes resources are done upgrading, upgrade the CRDs.

**Important**: Check the logs and status of the Karpenter pods that start up. If you have deprecated resources, the new Karpenter pods will fail to start. If this is the case you should go back to V1.0 and recheck your resources.

With that, your Karpenter upgrades are complete. From this point forward, any upgrade you need to do can be done using a simple `helma upgrade` since you are already on Helm. The one additional thing you have to do is to apply the new versions of the CRDs.

## Conclusion

This brings us to the end of the section on Karpenter upgrades. Remember that once you have completed this upgrade, the [official upgrade guide](https://karpenter.sh/preview/upgrading/upgrade-guide/) is all you need for future upgrades.
